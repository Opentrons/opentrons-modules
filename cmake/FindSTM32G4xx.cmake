FindSTM32G4xx
----------------

Provides a module find backend for the STM32G4xx board support package.

This should not be imported. It should be used with find_package:
``find_package(STM32G4xx COMPONENTS BSP FreeRTOS USB )``

When called with find package, it will add a static library target of the same
name, with appropriate definitions, suitable for use in target_link_library.

There are several available subcomponents that callers may want to pick and
choose from; some of them require different supporting setup in the calling
project. Each component is namespaced under STM32G4xx.

Provides the variables ``STM32G4xx_BSP_FOUND`` as a bool and ``STM32G4xx_BSP_DIR``
as the path to the source.

Each component has its own ``STM32G4xx_${COMPONENT}_FOUND`` and so on set
of exported variables.

The ``Drivers`` subcomponent is always selected no matter whether it is present
in the components list, since it is the fundamental part of the BSP.

Drivers
+++++++

The Drivers component (``STM32G4xx_Drivers``) contains the drivers and device
header files. ``find_package`` exported variables are
``STM32G4xx_Drivers_FOUND``, etc. This is the contents of the ``Drivers/``
subdirectory of the BSP.

You can select the Drivers component by adding ``Drivers`` to the ``COMPONENTS``
argument of ``find_package``: ``find_package(STM32G4xx COMPONENTS Drivers)``.
This can then be added to calling projects by calling
``target_link_libraries(mytarget STM32G4xx_Drivers)``.

Some options need to be set by the calling project on the imported
``STM32G4xx_Drivers`` target before it can be used. Specifically,

- ``target_compile_definitions`` should be used on the library target to set
the appropriate board definition for the boardfile for the specific processor
being used (i.e.
``target_compile_definitions(STM32G4xx_Drivers PUBLIC STM32G4xx)``)
- ``target_include_directories`` should be used to add an include directory that
contains the STM32 hal conf file ``stm32g4xx_hal_conf.h``, which is included by
the library to provide the individual HAL module enable/disable flags


FreeRTOS
++++++++

The FreeRTOS component (``STM32G4xx_FreeRTOS``) contains a port of FreeRTOS to
the STM32. This is the ``Middlewares/Third_Party/FreeRTOS`` subdirectory, or at
least most of it (this isn't compiler-sensitive, it always selects the GCC version
 of compiler-dependent options).

You can select the FreeRTOS component by adding ``FreeRTOS`` to the ``COMPONENTS``
argument of ``find_package``: ``find_package(STM32G4xx COMPONENTS FreeRTOS)``.
This can then be added to calling projects by calling
``target_link_libraries(mytarget STM32G4xx_FreeRTOS)``.

Some options need to be set by the calling project on the imported
``STM32G4xx_FreeRTOS`` target before it can be used. Specifically,

- ``target_compile_definitions`` should be used on the library target to set
the appropriate board definition for the boardfile for the specific processor
being used (i.e.
  ``target_compile_definitions(STM32G4xx_FreeRTOS PUBLIC STM32G4xx)``)
- ``target_include_directories`` should be used to add an include directory that
contains a ``FreeRTOSConfig.h`` file that sets FreeRTOS configuration options.
- The caller can also set a CMake property on the imported
``STM32G4xx_FreeRTOS`` component called ``FREERTOS_HEAP_IMPLEMENTATION`` to
select the heap implementation from the ones provided by freertos. These should
be the names of the one of the heap implementation c files without the extension,
e.g.
``set_target_properties(STM32G4xx_FreeRTOS PROPERTIES FREERTOS_HEAP_IMPLEMENTATION "heap_5")``

# structured so that each subsystem has stm32g4xx_hal_subsystem.c and
# stm32g4xx_hal_subsystem_ex.c, will have subsystem.c packed into the archive
# before hal_subsystem_ex.c. That breaks some of the hal code, which has weak definitions
# of some functions in subsystem.c that should be overridden in subsystem_ex.c, but
# if subsystem.c comes before subsystem_ex.c in the archive, the linker will pick
# the weak one. By reversing the order, we make subsystem_ex come befeore subsystem,
