/**
 * @file hal_util.h
 * @brief Provides utilities for working with the STM32 HAL libraries.
 * This file should only be #included into C source files, as the
 * HAL libraries are not safe for use with C++.
 * @details This file must be configured for each target. The CMakeLists
 * for each target should configure this file after defining the
 * variable STM_HAL_PREFIX to specify the STM32 hal to be included
 * (e.g. stm32g4xx, stm32f3xx).
 * 
 * Source files may #include this file as "firmware/hal_util.h"
